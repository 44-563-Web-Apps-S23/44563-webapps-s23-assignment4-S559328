    <h6>HYACINTH HALVEY BY LADY AUGUSTA GREGORY</h6>
    <p>SERGEANT. [_Opening and reading one by one._] "He possesses the fire of
        the Gael, the strength of the Norman, the vigor of the Dane, the
        stolidity of the Saxon----"
        <br>
        HYACINTH. It was the chairman of the Poor Law Guardians wrote that.
        <br>
        SERGEANT. "A magnificent example to old and young----"
        <br>
        HYACINTH. That was the secretary of the De Wet Hurling Club----
        <br>
        SERGEANT. "A shining example of the value conferred by an eminently
        careful and high-class education----"
        <br>
        HYACINTH. That was the national schoolmaster.
        <br>
        SERGEANT. "Devoted to the highest ideals of his motherland to such an
        extent as is compatible with a hitherto non-parliamentary career----"
        <br>
        HYACINTH. That was the member for Carrow.
        <br>
        SERGEANT. "A splendid exponent of the purity of the race----"
        <br>
        HYACINTH. The editor of the "Carrow Champion."
        <br>
        SERGEANT. "Admirably adapted for the efficient discharge of all possible
        duties that may in future be laid upon him----"
        <br>
        HYACINTH. The new station-master.
        <br>
        SERGEANT. "A champion of every cause that can legitimately benefit his
        fellow creatures--" Why, look here, my man, you are the very one to come
        to our assistance to-night.
        <br>
        HYACINTH. I would be glad to do that. What way can I do it?
        <br>
        SERGEANT. You are a newcomer--your example would carry weight--you must
        stand up as a living proof of the beneficial effect of a high character,
        moral fibre, temperance--there is something about it here I am
        sure--(_Looks._) I am sure I saw "unparalleled temperance" in some
        place----
